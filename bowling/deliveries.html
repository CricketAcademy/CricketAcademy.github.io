     <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Deliveries of Cricket </b></p> 
 <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Swing:</b> Swing can be controlled by the position of the seam and the smoothness of either side. 
 There are two main-ways to swing the ball, by presenting the seam upright and straight or by angling the seam towards the intended direction.
 If one side of the ball is shinier than the other, presenting the seam perfectly upright with lots of revolutions will cause the bowl to swing towards the rough side. 
 Using this method of swing, the inswinger is bowled by holding the rough side towards the batsman, and the outswinger the shiny side towards the batsman.
 The other method to swing the bowl is to angle the seam.
 Certain bowlers angle the seam using their wrist, others using their fingers, others a combination of both.
 The outswinger can be bowled by tilting the seam in your grip towards the slips. The inswinger can be bowled by tilting the seam towards fine-leg. 
 The wrist can also be used to angle the seam by 'karate chopping' the batsman to bowl an outswinger and the reverse to bowl the inswinger. 
 While, angling the seam is far more difficult than simply presenting it, the benefit is far more swing and not being reliant on the shininess of the ball. </p>
 <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Off-spin:</b> The standard off-break is bowled by turning the ball at delivery, as if turning a doorknob. 
 The offspinner also has variations, though not quite as sizeable as the legspinner. 
 The topspinner can be bowled by getting up and over the ball and ripping it downwards instead of towards the onside. 
 The armball is bowled by rolling the fingers down the seam like a pace ball. 
 This delivery should always be aimed at the stumps to bring in as many dismissals as possible.</p>
 <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Leg-spin:</b> The standard leg-break is bowled by rotating the fingers and wrist from right to left at delivery. 
 The topspinner can be bowled by pointing the back of the hand towards cover, with the thumb pointing at fine-leg. 
 The wrong-un can be bowled by pointing the back of the hand towards the batsman. 
The flipper can be bowled by clicking the ball out of the hand just like clicking your fingers.
The slider can be bowled by holding the ball like a pace bowler then bowling a normal leggie.  </p>
