   <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Batting Tips from other players/coaches</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Coach Gordon's Top Tips</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">1. Watch the ball. Too many players ignore this tip and try to find faults in their technique, when a lack of this is the most common cause for dismissal.
	   2. Look to score runs. Batsman need to have the intent to score, energy and focus on the ball.
	   3. Think positive. Picture yourself hitting a perfect cover drive, not edging to slips. 
	   In the same mindframe, look at the spaces not the fielders.
	   4. Play strong shots, avoid weak ones. 
	   Don't try and hit a shot you have never played before during a match, wait for your strong shot, whether it be the hook or the on-drive.
	   5. Batsman that stay in for a long time need to learn how to turn on and off their focus.
		Concentrating when the ball is active, and switching off when the ballis dead.
	   6. Learn to rotate strike. Rotating strike is an effective way to release pressure from a good bowler.
		The likelihood of getting dismissed decreases when you aren't stuck on the striker's end.
	   7. Don't overthink it. Whether you are making centuries or crispy ducks, if your technique has worked for you, then simply sticking to these tips should gradually improve your batting.
	   8. While batting is a mental game, it is important to ensure at least your fundamentals are strong, grip, stance etc.
