  <h1>Batting Tips</h1>
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Basics/Set-up Technique</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The ability to play a variety of shots to a variety of different deliveries is only possible with a fundamentally sound and comfortable set-up.
	A batsman's set up consists of three key factors, grip, stance and backlift. 
	While batsman will shape their own variations of these aspects over time (take Steve Smith), it is important to begin with the standard, technically sound set-up.  
    </p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>The Grip</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">An incorrect grip can prevent a batsman from being able to hit to certain sides of the ground, and have less control of the trajectory of the ball.
	The standard, recommended grip to allow 360 degree strokeplay and effective shot-execution is one where the top and bottom hand are aligned down the spine of the bat.
	This grip is formed by placing the V between the thumb and index finger of both hands straight down, or slightly to the left of the spine of the bat. 
	The top-hand should hold the bat firmly and essentially steer/lead the bat.
	The bottom-hand is the power hand however, it is standard to grip the bat slightly looser/softer than the top-hand.
	The natural way to achieve this grip is to place the bat face-down against the floor and then pick it up. 
	Your hands should naturally wrap around the handle in your ideal and comfortable grip position.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>The Stance</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> A batsman's stance is their base to react to all deliveries and play all shots. 
	Therefore, it must be comfortable, balanced and allow nimble footwork.
	The feet should be roughly shoulder width apart (though this can be changed as the batsman develops) with knees bent slightly.
	The chin should be over the toes to maintain the centre of gravity and the head balanced.
	The eyes need to be level to allow them to track and respond to the line and length of the ball earlier.
	The toes and hips should line up back towards the bowler putting the batsman into a side-on position.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>The Backlift</b> </p>	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">A sound backlift allows power through the downswing and control of the lateness of the shot.
	The bat is lifted while the batsman moves towards the ball and then driven down to hit the ball.
	The backlift comes naturally to most players however, there are dangers to look out for.
	The toe of the bat when lifted cannot be angled to fine-leg. 
	This will require the bat coming around the body to hit the ball meaning that the batsman only has access to the leg-side.</p>
	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Footwork</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The key to playing a powerful yet controlled stroke is decisive and balanced footwork. 
	A lack of footwork is a common cause for wickets falling, whether it be an edge, an lbw or plain bowled, bad footwork increases the chance of almost every type of dismissal.
	For full-pitched deliveries, the batsman should look to get a full and balanced stride forward, with the head over the ball.
	This is commonly referred to as getting your pad to the line of the ball.
	Not only will this assist the chances of bat on ball and improve power and ability to hit the ball across the ground, it will reduce the consequences of seam movement.
	For balls that are pitched shorter, a back and across movement to get the head inside the line of the ball is commonly used.
	When playing a short ball the batsman should move onto their toes allowing them to get above the ball and hit the ball down.
	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Concentration</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> Watching and focusing on the ball closely for long periods of time is one of the most common difficulties among cricketers, whether junior or international.
	When Ab De Villiers, South African Captain, is dismissed, he regularly finds a drop of concentration to be the fault.
	While watching the ball might seem incredibly easy and a given when batting, many beginner players do not watch the ball as closely or for as long as advanced batsman.
	The batsman should be fiercely concentrating on watching the ball out of the bowler's hand onto the face of the bat.
	Many amateur batsman don't focus on the ball coming out of the bowler's hand and instead, simply look at the general area.
	Watching the ball onto the bat, allows you to effectively observe pace, swing and spin execute the correct shot.</p>
	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Playing every ball on its merits.</b> </p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> This is the frame of mind where the batsman watches the ball,and plays it accordingly. 
	If the ball is on a good line and length, the batsman won't try and ramp or hook it for six.
	Playing a ball on its merits is particularly important in longer forms of the game where keeping your wicket is essential to a high score.
	
	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Shots</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">With the fundamentals correctly developed, a batsman can move onto increasing their arsenal of shots.
	The core shots to learn as a beginner batsman are the front-foot defensives and drives and the back-foot drives and cross-bat shots.
	Once these shots have been mastered, the player can look to develop aggressive or unique shots such as the sweep and the glance.
	</p>
	
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Front-foot shots</b></p>
	When playing forward, the batsman should take a full, comfortable stride towards the line of the ball.
	The front knee should be bent with the back leg straightened and on its toes to keep the body and head down.
	Do not take too large or too short a stride as this will reduce balance.
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The front foot defense is one of the key strokes in a batsman's arsenal. 
	It should be played late with figure 9 elbows so the ball bounces under your eyes.
	The front-foot drives and lofts are an extension of this block.
	Front foot aggressive shots share all the same technical aspects as the defensive but they are played earlier and with more force.
	When playing a drive it is important to keep the figure 9 with the elbows and lead with the top hand.
	A couples drills to practice drives are:</p> 
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">To get a partner to drop a ball in between two stumps and drive through the stumps.</p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> Place a ball on a cone, and practice stepping out to it and hitting the ball </p>

	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Back-foot Shots</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> A batsman will play a backfoot shot when the ball is pitched short so it bounces above the batsman's hips.
		When playing on the backfoot, the player should look to make a back and across offstump movement.
		From here the batsman is in a position to play to the offside or the legside, straight-bat or cross-bat depending on the line and length of the ball.
		When playing drives, ensure the bat is lead by the top hand and the face of the bat angles down slightly.
		The key to playing backfoot strokes is to be confident, not worry about injury and watch the ball.

	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> <b>Batting Tips from other players/coaches</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Coach Gordon's Top Tips</b></p>
	<p style="font-family:helvetica;">1. Watch the ball. Too many players ignore this tip and try to find faults in their technique, when a lack of this is the most common cause for dismissal.
	   2. Look to score runs. Batsman need to have the intent to score, energy and focus on the ball.
	   3. Think positive. Picture yourself hitting a perfect cover drive, not edging to slips. 
	   In the same mindframe, look at the spaces not the fielders.
	   4. Play strong shots, avoid weak ones. 
	   Don't try and hit a shot you have never played before during a match, wait for your strong shot, whether it be the hook or the on-drive.
	   5. Batsman that stay in for a long time need to learn how to turn on and off their focus.
		Concentrating when the ball is active, and switching off when the ballis dead.
	   6. Learn to rotate strike. Rotating strike is an effective way to release pressure from a good bowler.
		The likelihood of getting dismissed decreases when you aren't stuck on the striker's end.
	   7. Don't overthink it. Whether you are making centuries or crispy ducks, if your technique has worked for you, then simply sticking to these tips should gradually improve your batting.
	   8. While batting is a mental game, it is important to ensure at least your fundamentals are strong, grip, stance etc.
	</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Tips Against Spin Bowlers</b></p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;"> 1. Watch the seam, fingers and hand to determine which way the ball will spin.
	2. Pick up the line and length of the ball early.
	3. Decisive footwork, move to the ball quickly.
	4.Commit to the ball. Once you have chosen your shot, take a full-stride forward or backward and get into a solid position to play the shot.
	Don't be afraid to use your feet. Come up the wicket to put the bowler off their length.
	The key aspect to avoid when charging, is telegraphing the decision before the ball is delivered.
	5. Focus. Don't think of a spinner as just relief, continue to focus on them like you would a good pace bowler.
	6. Softs hands when playing strokes, don't go too hard at the ball.
	7. Practice your strokes, learn the sweepshot to gain an additional run-scoring option and put the pressure back on the bowler.</p>
</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Training Effectively.</b></p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Train smart and hard. Training shouldn't be considered a time to mess around. 
On top of club trainings, if you want to be truly success, you should visit the local nets multiple times throughout the week.
That is the training hard aspect. Training smart is to perform focused drills to improve the most during this time.
You must practice as if you were playing in a game.
Aim to not get out in a session, if you don't get out, you have scored a century;once - 50 runs.
Divide the batting session into different situations demanding different scoring rates, ie. first 10 mins - defense, next 10 mins-sensible attacking shots, next 10 - aggressive lofts.
Don't worry about the last dismissal, only focus on the present.
