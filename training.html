     <h1>Training Effectively</h1>
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;"><b>Train smart and hard.</b></p> 
    <img src='/images/control.jpg' alt='Accuracy Control' style="width:518px; height:354px;" />
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;"><i>Training shouldn't be considered a time to mess around.</i></p>
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;">On top of club trainings, if you want to be truly successful, you should visit the local nets multiple times throughout the week.
    That is the <i>training hard</i> aspect.</p>
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;"> Training smart is to perform focused drills to improve the most during this time.
    The aim of bowling is to take wickets, so take wickets.
    Net sessions are the ideal place to practice the plans described in this website.
    When practicing a certain skill, such as accuracy ,swing or spin, focus on that skill.
    Lay cones down on a line and length and record how many times you hit them to practice accuracy.
    Create a channel out of cones to practice swing.
    Focus on just hitting the deck as hard as possible, disregarding accuracy to practice speed.
    When training batting, you must practice as if you were playing in a game.
    Aim to not get out in a session, if you don't get out, you have scored a century;once - 50 runs.
    Divide the batting session into different situations demanding different scoring rates, ie. first 10 mins - defense, next 10 mins-sensible attacking shots, next 10 - aggressive lofts.
    Don't worry about the last dismissal, only focus on the present.</p>
