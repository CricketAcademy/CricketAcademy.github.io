     <p>I am a 15 year old cricket enthusiast who has played and watched the game, since I was 5. 
      I started club cricket at the age of 9, and soon developed a passion for it. 
      I practiced and practiced, usually by myself, but that didn't faze me.
      I researched tips online and tried to implement them in practice, whether it was a new shot or how to bowl faster.
      I didn't have access to good coaching or books to learn from. 
      However, thanks to the online tips I was able to find and practice, I improved and made it to div 1.
      My years of online research are what inspired me to create this website.
      Since making it to div 1 and trialling for the ACT comets team, I have picked up lots of information from a variety of different cricketers.
      This website is a compilation of the information which I have gathered throughout my journey.</p>
