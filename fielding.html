        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Fielding, though often overlooked, is just as important as bowling and batting and should be developed equally.
        Fielding involves ground fielding, throwing and catching.
        There are two main kinds of ground-fielding, attacking and defensive, generally dependant on whether there is a run-out opportunity or not.
        Technical points to remember when attacking the ball include:</p>
        <ul><li>Back foot right angled to the ball, hips and toes aligned with stumps.</li>
        <li>Low centre of gravity with bent knees</li>
        <li> Watch the ball all the way into the hands.</li>
        <li>Technical points when on the defensive:</li>
        <li>Your body should be preventing the ball from going past even if it misses the hands.</li>
        <li>Watch the ball</li></ul>
    
    <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Throwing: the two throws used while fielding are overarm and underarm.
         Which throw is determined by the situation, but will usually be the overarm. 
        The underarm throw is only used when extremely close to the stumps or when the ball is dead. 
        The benefit of the underarm throw is that it is slower and gentle but it can be thrown quicker.</p>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Key points for overarm throws:</p>
        <ul><li>Grip the ball across-the-seam to prevent swing when throwing.</li>
        <li>Front-arm points to target, pulls in past hip when throwing</li>
        <li>Throwing arm goes back and high so the elbow is above the shoulder.</li></ul>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Key points for underarm throws:</p>
        <ul><li>Stay front on with fingers pointing down when gathering the ball.</li>
        <li> Throwing arm goes straight backthen straight through the target.</li>
        <li>Keep your wrist firm (do not flick) when throwing otherwise the ball will go higher than expected.</li></ul>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Catching </p>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">There are two different acceptable techniques for catching, fingers up and fingers down.
            Fingers up is generally used when the ball is flat and above shoulder-level.
            Fingers down is generally used when the ball is loopier and lower than the chest.
            Both these methods must be practiced frequently to become a top fielder and prevent injury from catching.
            When fielding in the mid or outfield, it is important to get to the ball as quickly as possible and be stable when going for the catch.
            When fielding in the slips, it is essential to watch the ball from the bat every ball.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">The last key tip is attitude. 
           If you desire wickets and catches, wanting the ball to come to you every delivery, you will be sharper in the field and win matches. </p>
