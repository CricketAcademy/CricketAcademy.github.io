    <p>Fitness and physical conditioning is often overlooked when practicing, however, to optimise performance, a cricketer must improve these along with their other skills.
        The combination of endurance and strength is key to gaining an edge.
        Let's use an example with two bowlers, Tait and Lee, to prove this.
        Tait and Lee are similar bowlers, both fast, accurate and take roughly the same number of wickets an over.
        The only difference, is that Lee who constantly trains to improve his endurance, can bowl 12 overs to Tait's 2 overs.
        Which one will get picked? Obviously the one who can bowl more overs and take more wickets. 
        This is the kind of edge fitness training provides. Other benefits are:</p>
        <ul><li>Stonger batsman can hit more boundaries</li>
        <li>Faster batsman can steal more runs</li>
        <li>Batsman with more stamina can run for longer without feeling exhaustion</li>
        <li> Fitter bowlers can maintain pace and accuracy</li>
        <li>Fitter fieldsman can chase down faster bowls and constantly be in the action</li></ul>
    <p> All these benefits should have convinced you of the importance of fitness in cricket,
    but how do you become fit? </p>
    <p> The key to remember, is that your goal is to become cricket-fit, not bodybuilder fit nor soccer fit, or even marathon-fit.
            How do you become cricket-fit? It is about the muscles you train and the way you train.
        You don't want to strength train and end up looking like a bodybuilder because you will lose speed and endurance, this is not cricket-fit.
        With this in mind, here is a basic training plan for your strength and endurance.
    
    </p>
    <p> <b>Strength Training</b></p>
    <ul><li>Pushups - great compound movement to strengthen core and chest. Added benefit is that it is a bodyweight exercise.</li>
    <li>Plank - stregthening core</li>
    <li>Squats - strengthens exlposive leg muscles</li>
    <li>Sprints - 20 meteres sprints to imitate running between wickets and chasing when fielding</li>
    <li> Deadlifts - compound movement forces core, legs and chest to work.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p><b>Endurance Training</b></p>
    <ul><li>Distance Runs</li>
    <li>Bowling longer spells under fatigue</li>
    <li>Follow up intensive training with bowling or batting to imitate death overs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Injury Prevention</b></p>
    <p> Cricket can be a dangerous game, so it is important to take any safety measures possible to prevent injury.</p>
<ul><li>Do not overtrain. Practicing more than 2 hours a day, numerous days in the week will lead to muscle strain </li>
    <li>Always wear safety gear when batting</li>
    <li> Check your bowling action to make sure you haven't got a mixed action</li>
    <li>Use a safe catching technique to prevent broken fingers</li></ul>
